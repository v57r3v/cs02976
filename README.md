IE-GY 6213 A “Facility Planning and Design” 
Spring 2024
Course Description: A practical   approach to   facility   planning   and   design   with   an emphasis on real world issues rather than solely theory and detailed analysis. The course is reasonably general to encompass a broad range of facilities including offices, hospitals, schools, industrial facilities etc, while leaning towards industrial facilities and master industrial   site   planning.   See   course   objectives   and   lecture   descriptions   below.
Course Objectives: 
1.         Gain   an understanding   of   the phasing   of facility   design   work   and   its
importance   in   the   engineering   and   construction   field   today
2.         Learn   how   to   layout   an   industrial   plant   from   a practical point   of   view.
3.         Understand   the   various   engineering   entities   involved   in   planning   and   design,   and   the   complexity   of   their   interactions.
4.         Understand   how planning   and   design   techniques   involved   in   an   industrial
plant   apply   to   other   facilities   such   as   offices,   hospitals,   schools,   etc.
5.          Gain   an understanding   of the   role   that   the   legal   component   plays   in   the
planning,   design   and permitting   process.
6.         Understand   how   to   develop   a   budget   estimate   for the   capital   investment
required   for   the   design   and   construction   of   facilities   and   how   different   techniques   apply   to   different   design   phases.
7.         Gain   an introductory understanding   of   project   management   and   how   it
impacts   the planning   and   design   process.
Course Structure: Lectures,   class   discussion,   assignments   and   some   assignment
presentations,   Term   Project   and presentation,   mid-term   and   final   exams.   Exams   will   be   on-line   via   Brightspace but   will   be   taken   in-class   at   normal   class   time   on   the   dates scheduled.

代做程序编程语言ements: Reading   of specific handouts,   class participation,   homework assignments (some with brief class presentations), mid-term exam, term project (working in teams with 15 - 20 min in-class presentation) and final exam. Reading of class lecture slides prior to the class is optional. Lecture slides are supplemented by and expanded upon by oral presentation by the professor each week. Simply reading and memorizing slides is not adequate preparation for exams….understanding of the material presented is required. 
Course   grades   will   be   calculated per the weighting   below:
Assignments: Minimum   of five   (5)   assignments 15% of final grade 
#1      Phases   of   Design   (5 min   class presentation   required)
#2    Building   Codes   and   FAR   Calculation
#3    Reverse   Cumulative Yield   Calculation
#4      Footprint   Calculation
#5      Material   Handling   Equipment   Systems   (5   min   class   presentation   required   –   work   can   be   done   with   same   team   as   assigned   for   Term   Project   or   individually)
Assignments   are   due   the   following   week unless   advised   otherwise.    All   assignments   are   to be   done without   collaboration unless   Prof   Posner   advises   otherwise.
Mid-term Exam:  30% of final grade 
Term Project (working in teams assigned by Prof):       20% of final grade 
Term project   is   a   Preliminary   Phase   Design   of an   industrial   facility.   In-class   20   min presentation required.
Final Exam (based on entire semester):  35% of final grade 
Total 100% 
Notes: 
1.       Course   grades will   be   calculated   as   above.   There   are   no   opportunities   for   extracredit   at   any time unless   included   in the   exam   itself.   Nor   are there   opportunities   for   grade   changes   once   grades   for the   course have   been posted   on   Albert.   Students   are   advised   to   please   not   ask   for   such   a   change.
2.       AI –   Students should not use   AI   tools   in   this   course   unless   specifically   noted   as
allowed   in   the   description   of   a   specific   assignment   or   exam/quiz
